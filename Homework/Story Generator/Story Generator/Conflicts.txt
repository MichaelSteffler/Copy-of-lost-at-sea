@1 works as a #1 but has no friends except for @2 who is $2 and works as #2 because they are too $1 and tired. One day they decided to buy a lottery ticket at % at the local ^ down the street. @1 and @2 won. Yay. @1 and @2 lived happily ever after and bought out the lottery company along with a yacht. 
@1 and @2 work together as a #1 and #2 but on % both if their bosses gave them the day off. @1 being the $1 that they is decided that they should go to the beach, so @1 and @2 did. And they had a ton of fun eventhough @2 was being a $2 person.
It all fell apart % when @1 quit their job as a #1 and their $1 got the best of them and so they just couldn't stand working for @2 because he is such a $2 person. A few days later @2 was walking past ^ when it suddenly began raining heavily and then BOOM! CRASH! It all went black. @2 had been hit by a car, and @1 was driving! @1 called an ambulance and the grief of his intolerance of working with @2 weighed heavy on him. " @2 came out of nowhere!" @1 kept telling himself, and so he did his best to comfort @2 while the ambulance came. It didn't arrive fast enough though and @2 died in their arms.
In % at ^ there was @1 who is a $1 person that was a #1 and they liked their job. They was fired by their $2 boss named @2 and their boss was a #2 person. Then, when @1 went home, they saw their house had burned down.
@1 who is a $1 person that was a #1 was walking in ^ at % when he ran into a $2 person. The $2 person said "Hi my name is @2 and I am a #2 for amazon." @1 was instantly in love and they got married.
@1 who is a $1 person that was a #1 had cancer. However while sick, they met @2 who is a $2 person that was a #2 at % in ^ . They fell in love and got married. Then @1 was cured of cancer and they lived together for the rest of their lives.
At % in the local ^ down the road, @1 and @2 were having a duel over a french bulldog named Toby. @1 because of his poor training to be a #1 allowed himself to wound @2 but was wounded back by @2 because they forgot about their $2 and they both ended up bleeding out and dying, neither truly winning Toby.
@1 received a doctor's note 3 days ago at % and it said that he had contracted a horrible disease that would kill them four days from now. This was horrible because the disease is horribly contagious and @1 ate dinner with @2 just yesterday. @1 had to tell @2 but they wasn't sure how to tell @2 that they both were going to die. @1 never ended up telling @2 and @1 passed away with @2 soon after.
In % at ^ there was @1 who is a $1 person that was a #1 was walking to see @2 who is a $2 person that was a #2 when they were stabbed by a masked person. The person took their mask off and shockingly, it was @2 and they laughed.
In % at ^ there was @1 who is a $1 person that was a #1 was going to rob a bank when they were stopped by a superhero. They pulled off the heroes disguise and it was their friend @2 who is a $2 person that was a #2 at amazon.
